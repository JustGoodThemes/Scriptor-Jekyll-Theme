## Afternoon Glendalough, Ireland Hotdog Walk

Let's set the stage before the hotdog review. I'm in Glendalough, Ireland, at
least 5,500km away from home, finished what is probably the _longest_ hike
known to man, and it's around 1200. The only thing I've had to eat today was a
big ole slice of pie, some granola bars, and a lot of water. So you could say
I'm up to my forehead of being absolutely famished!

Now that you know what I am feeling and just accomplished, you'll get a better
sense on my review of what is probably the _longest_ hotdog known to man.

But before I get to the review, let me give you a brief history of Irelands
hotdogs. Some of you already know this but in Ireland, they sit in the right
hand side of the car and drive on the left side of the road while driving
stick. Americans might be confused as to why this is and they claim that
Ireland (and other countries) drive on the wrong side of the road. But did you
know they did this because of an accident that led to a 5 year old girl to death
back in 1700's?

You see, some young bloke was driving his horse cartage on the right side of
the road while sitting on the left side of the cart, and this young bloke was
eating a hotdog with his right hand (which is his dominant hand) while trying
to shift gears in his horse also with his right hand. This young bloke tried
reached his left hand over to shift gears on his horse where he smacked his
right hand and dropped his hotdog on the floor. The hotdog rolled up to the gas
pedal and slamed down on it which led to the horse cartage to go full force of
2 horses power.

At the same time, the 5 year old girl was crossing the street when the young
bloke was going full force with his 2 horses power horse cartage. The horses
trampled over the 5 year old girl which led to her death 40 years later of
natural causes. When the police came to her death bed, her last words were

> If only we could drive on the left side of the road while sit on the right
> side of the car, we could enjoy our eating our hotdogs while changing gears
> safely on our horse cartage, I would've lived a couple more years and eaten a
> couple more hotdogs.

This is the reason why people around Europe drive on the other side.

Now that you know why people drive on the other side of the road in Europe,
you'll get a better sense on my review as to why I think getting this hotdog
was what is probably the _longest_ time to wait in line to order a hotdog.

You see, after the hike my friends and I went to order our hotdog and we waited
in line. There was a family of three ahead of us ordering their hotdog where
they ordered six hotdogs. But it wasn't like "We'll have six hotdogs", it was
"We'll have three hotdogs" and then the youngest girl was "no daddy! I want
_two_ hotdogs!" and the older sister said "yeah dad, I want _two_ hotdogs". So
the dad said to the cashier lady "Alright, we'll have five hotdogs". The
cashier lady added those two hotdogs to the order and the cashier lady said,
"would you like everything on it? Onions, mustard, ketchup." and the girls
started to cry. Oh my gosh! They cried to their dad saying "dad, we hate
onions, mustard, and ketchup". So the dad told the cashier lady, "please stop,
don't add that to the hotdogs. Don't you see what you're doing to my childern!
You're hurting them." and the cashier lady had to restart the order completely.
Then the dad said, "since you made my childern cry could I have _two_ hotdogs
with no onions, mustard, and ketchup?" to the cashier lady. So in total they
order six hotdogs for a family of three with no onions, mustard, and ketchup.

What a rollercoaster of emotions I just witnessed.

I walked up to the cashier lady after the family of three order their six
hotdogs, and I didn't want to cause any more trouble to this cashier lady after
what I just witnessed so I went for the most basic order of all; _one_ hotdog
with everything on it with _one_ bag of fries and with _one_ can of diet coke.
No troubles. No issues. No changes to the hotdog. Just a basic order.

Seeing that the family of three ordered six hotdogs, I knew that I was going to
wait for my hotdog for at least 2 hours before they got theirs. But to my
suprise, I got my _one_ hotdog with everything on it with _one_ bag of fries
and with _one_ can of diet coke before the family of three got their six
hotdogs.

I walked up to get my _one_ hotdog with everything on it with _one_ bag of
fries and with _one_ can of diet coke and gave a drooling simle to the family
of three got their six hotdogs because I got mine before them because I didn't
cause any troubles to the cashier lady.

I grabbed my hotdog and a gust of air came out of my mouth because I wasn't
prepared for what I was about to hold. This, I told myself, is probably the
_longest_ hotdog known to man and I am about to eat it after doing what is
probably the _longest_ hike know to man and having to wait in what is probably
the _longest_ time to stand in line to order a hotdog.

I walked to my table where my friend was waiting for me and I told her, "you
won't believe what I just witnessed" and I told her the story of the family of
three ordering six hotdogs and then crying when asked if they want onions,
mustard, and ketchup on their hotdogs.

I unwrap my hotdog and I saw beauty. The hotdog was cooked first on the grill
then deep fried to make the outside crunch while maintaining the inside juicy.
The onions were also deep fried. The bun was not deep fried but it was toasted
on the grill. Biting onto the hotdog and hand to God, I was in contact with the
5 year old girl that got trampled by the 2 horses power horse cartage that was
driven by the young bloke that dropped his hotdog while trying to shift gears
on with his left hand. I felt her when she expressed her last words on changing
the way they drive in Ireland.

The hotdog was that good, it popped me back into a fifth dimension where I
could see time, space, and taste differently than this pathetic dimension I
live in.

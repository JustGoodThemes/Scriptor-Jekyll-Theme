**Aera Han** is a current BS/MS student at Rochester Institute of Technology studying Computing Security. 

She grew up with a love for technology and computers and soon found a passion for information security - which led to the birth of this blog.

Aera's hope for this blog is simply to document her growth and learning, and serve as a reference and review source and archive to jog her memory when needed. If it ends up helping someone else along the way, that's a plus!
